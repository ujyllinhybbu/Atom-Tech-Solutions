# Overview
This project was developed during my Web Development Internship at Atom Tech Solutions (Sep 2023 â€“ Nov 2023) as part of a mock coding exercise.
The original project structure and some core functionalities were provided by the company as a learning foundation.
I contributed by modifying existing code, enhancing features, and practicing full-stack development skills through hands-on exercises.
