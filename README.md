# Atom-Tech-Solutions
Web Development Internship

Overview
This project was developed during my Web Development Internship at Atom Tech Solutions (Sep 2023 â€“ Nov 2023) as part of a mock coding exercise.
It simulates key functionalities of the Yelp platform, including user authentication, review posting, and database management using a full-stack JavaScript environment.

Note: This project is a learning exercise and contains no real company data or confidential information.

Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Templating Engine: EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)

Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose.js ODM)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (inside EJS templates)

Tools: Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub

Features
User Authentication: User signup, login, and session management.

Review System: Users can create, view, update, and delete reviews for businesses.

Business Listings: Create and manage businesses similar to Yelp.

Database Seeding: Pre-populate the database with sample cities and businesses.

Responsive UI: Simple, clean interfaces built with EJS templates and CSS.

RESTful Routing: Proper RESTful route structure for resources (businesses, reviews).

Team Collaboration: Worked within a team environment with regular meetings and code reviews.

What I Learned
Building a full-stack web application with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries.

Structuring a backend server and building REST APIs with Express.js.

Using MongoDB and Mongoose for dynamic and scalable data storage.
